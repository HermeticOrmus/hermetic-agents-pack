## Development Notes

### Testing
- Agents tested in production environments
- Validated across multiple project types
- Real-world usage over 6+ months
- Community feedback incorporated

### Design Decisions
- **Automatic delegation**: Simplifies usage for most common cases
- **Manual override**: Provides control when needed
- **Zero dependencies**: Ensures compatibility and easy installation
- **Specialized agents**: Better than general-purpose for quality
- **6-day cycle focus**: Optimized for rapid iteration

### Known Limitations
- Agent selection depends on task description clarity
- Some agents may need explicit invocation for edge cases
- Agent responses limited by Claude Code's capabilities

### Future Considerations
- Agent customization per user/team
- Learning from usage patterns
- Integration with project management tools
- Enhanced collaboration features
