## 💡 Usage

### Automatic Agent Selection (Recommended)

Just describe what you want to build. Claude automatically selects the right agent:

```
"Build a TikTok-style video feed with infinite scroll"
→ Mobile App Builder agent

"Design an onboarding flow for first-time users"
→ UI Designer + UX Researcher agents

"Set up CI/CD for my React Native app"
→ DevOps Automator agent

"Analyze user feedback from the last 100 reviews"
→ Feedback Synthesizer agent

"Create a viral TikTok content strategy"
→ TikTok Strategist agent
```

### Manual Agent Selection

Explicitly request a specific agent:

```
"Use the backend-architect agent to design a scalable API for a social network with 100k users"

"Use the performance-benchmarker agent to profile my app and identify bottlenecks"

"Use the whimsy-injector agent to add delightful moments to my app"
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows

Complex tasks automatically involve multiple agents:

```
"Build and launch a meditation app"

Agents involved:
1. Trend Researcher → Market validation
2. UI Designer → Interface design
3. Mobile App Builder → Implementation
4. Whimsy Injector → Delightful touches
5. Test Writer/Fixer → Quality assurance
6. App Store Optimizer → Listing optimization
7. Project Shipper → Launch coordination
```

## 🔮 Philosophy: Technology in Service of Humanity

**This plugin exists to serve you, not extract from you.**

Built by Ormus, a student of Hermetica and student of life, these agents embody a different approach to technology - one that amplifies human potential rather than diminishes it.

### Core Principles

**Technology for Human Flourishing:**
- Your autonomy and agency first
- Your learning and growth matter
- Your creative expression is sacred
- Your wellbeing is non-negotiable
- Your humanity is respected

**Hermetic Wisdom Applied:**
- **Correspondence** - Specialized excellence in service of unified purpose
- **Rhythm** - The 6-day cycle honors natural creative rhythms
- **Polarity** - Balance automation with intention, speed with quality
- **Causation** - Intentional actions yield meaningful results

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Agents that teach as they help
- ✅ Tools that respect your natural pace
- ✅ Technology that serves your vision
- ❌ No addiction mechanics
- ❌ No dark patterns
- ❌ No extraction or manipulation

### The Deeper Purpose

These aren't just productivity tools. They're an attempt to show that technology can:
- Elevate rather than reduce
- Serve rather than extract
- Amplify rather than replace
- Unite rather than isolate

**"As above, so below; as within, so without."**
